# WTWR PROJECT SERIES

## Project 12 - Introduction to Back-End: Node.js and Express.js:

### Overview:

- Intro
- Features
- Links

### Intro:

- The back-end portion of this project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application.

- With it I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote machine.

- The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization, for which this project served as a first step.

- This project can be run with these prompts:

- - `npm run start` — to launch the server

- - `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features:

- Server-Side Development
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman
- REST API
- Databases
- MongoDB
- SQL

## Project 13 - Back-End Authentication and Authorization:

### Overview:

- Intro
- Features
- Links

### Intro:

This phase of the WTWR project focuses on implementing user authentication and authorization features. The key additions include:

- User registration and login functionality with secure password handling
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Protected routes that require user authentication
- User authorization to ensure users can only modify their own data
- Enhanced error handling and input validation using regular expressions

This implementation ensures secure user management while maintaining the RESTful architecture established in the previous sprint.

- This project can be run with these prompts:

- - `npm run start` — to launch the server

- - `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features:

- Server-Side Authentication and Authorization
- Authentication Methods
- Authorization Methods
- JS Web Tokens
- JS Regular Expressions (Regexs)

### Intro:

- Project 14 of the WTWR Series was my first ever full-stack one in that it taught me to connect both the front-end and the back-end aspects of it.

- Also, it introduced me to several cybersecurity concepts as they pertain to Web Application Security.

### Features:

- Fron-End Authentication with React
- Web Application Security

## Project 15 - Automated Testing and Cloud Deployment:

### Overview:

- Intro
- Features
- Links

### Intro:

- Not only was Project 15 the final one of the WTWR Series, but it also expanded on the interplay between Backend and Frontend, as far as Full-Stack Software Engineering goes.

- Moreover, it taught me about both Automated Testing and Advanced Middleware, with the latter being instrumental to understanding Cybersecurity.

- Thanks to Project 15, I was introduced to the work of Cloud Deployment by way of Google Cloud.

- I am confident that learning about Google Cloud will serve as a foundation to learning about AWS.

### Features:

- Automated Testing
- Advanced Middleware
- Deploying and Hosting in the Cloud
