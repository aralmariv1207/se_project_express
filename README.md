# WTWR PROJECT SERIES

## Project 12 - Introduction to Back-End: Node.js and Express.js:

### Overview:

- Intro
- Features
- Links

### Intro:

- The back-end portion of this project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application.

- With it I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote machine.

- The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization, for which this project served as a first step.

- This project can be run with these prompts:

- - `npm run start` — to launch the server

- - `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features:

- Server-Side Development
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman
- REST API
- Databases
- MongoDB
- SQL

### Intro:

This phase of the WTWR project focuses on implementing user authentication and authorization features. The key additions include:

- User registration and login functionality with secure password handling
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Protected routes that require user authentication
- User authorization to ensure users can only modify their own data
- Enhanced error handling and input validation using regular expressions

This implementation ensures secure user management while maintaining the RESTful architecture established in the previous sprint.

- This project can be run with these prompts:

- - `npm run start` — to launch the server

- - `npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features:

- Server-Side Authentication and Authorization
- Authentication Methods
- Authorization Methods
- JS Web Tokens
- JS Regular Expressions (Regexs)
